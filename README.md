## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- HTML5

### What I learned

I learnt how to Flexbox's properties to center the card on the page.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
  <main>

    <article class="card">
      <picture>
      </picture>
      <div class="card__content">
      </div>
    </article>
  </main>
```
```css
body,
main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I am using Kevin Powell's course on Conquering Responsive Layouts to improve my knowledge on Flexbox. I find his course really helpful.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Really simple and awesome article by CSS Tricks.
- [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts) - This is a 21-day FREE challenge created by Kevin. This has really helped me a whole lot.
